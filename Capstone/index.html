            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>Drought is a recurring climatic disaster that severely affects food security in Kenya, particularly in the northeastern region and Rift Valley. The research aims to investigate the role of GIS mapping and remote sensing in assessing the impact of drought on food security in these regions. The project will use Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and other geospatial tools to map and monitor vegetation structure, water resources, and drought-prone areas.</p>
            <p>The research is significant in outlining a comprehensive spatial distribution of Kenya food baskets and drought prone areas. Aditionally, this study could also guide policy makers and other stakeholders in formulating strategies and methods in controlling and managing drought occurences.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Kenya is a country that faces several challenges in achieving food security due to a combination of natural and human-induced factors. These factors include drought, urbanization, and industrialization which impact the country's agricultural production and food security (Ayugi, 2022). This study aims to investigate the impact of drought, urbanization, and industrialization on food security in Kenya, with a particular focus on the Northeastern and Rift Valley regions.</p>
            <p>Drought is a recurring problem in Kenya and has been identified as one of the major causes of food insecurity in the country (Mwangi, 2020). In addition, urbanization and industrialization have led to the conversion of large tracts of agricultural land into built-up areas, further exacerbating the problem of food insecurity (MoALF&C, 2021). The Northeastern and Rift Valley regions of Kenya are particularly vulnerable to these challenges, given their arid and semi-arid climates and limited access to water resources.</p>
            <p>To address the problem of food insecurity in Kenya's Northeastern and Rift Valley regions, this study will investigate the following research questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the extent and severity of drought in the Northeastern and Rift Valley regions of Kenya, and how does this impact food security?</li>
                <li>What is the impact of environmental and human factors on food security in the Northeastern and Rift Valley regions of Kenya?</li>
                <li>How can geospatial data and analysis be used to improve drought management and food security in the Northeastern and Rift Valley regions of Kenya?  </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Kenya is an agricultural country, with the sector contributing about 26% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing more than 40% of the population (MoALF&C, 2021). However, the country has struggled with food insecurity due to several factors such as climate change, political instability, and economic factors. Kenya's climate is mostly arid and semi-arid, with some areas receiving very little rainfall throughout the year. This makes the country vulnerable to drought, as a result affecting agricultural production and food security. (Ayugi, 2022).</p>
            <p>In recent years, geospatial data and analysis has become important tools for addressing food security challenges. By using satellite imagery and other geospatial data sources, researchers and policymakers can identify areas that are vulnerable to drought and monitor changes in land use and cover. GIS mapping has also been used to develop early warning systems for drought and to develop targeted interventions to address food insecurity (GIS and  remote sensing for drought management in Africa. , 2021).</p>
            <p>This study therefore aims to apply NVDI data in monitoring environmental changes and identifying trends in relation to drought occurences in the region. This would be achieved through mapping and spatial analysis of NVDI data from 2010 to 2020, which would be compared through quantitative analysis of the drought extent in the region to determine the trends and formulate strategies for drought management and control.</p>

            <h1>Literature Review</h1>
            <p>The literature review sought to determine approaches used in drought analysis, impact and mitigation. The key areas of focus include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The use of GIS tools for identifying and monitoring drought-prone areas in Kenya</li>
                <li>The impact of anthropogenic activities on the occurrence and severity of drought in Kenya and its implications on food security.</li>
                <li>Effective Strategies in drought preparedness management.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1: GIS and Remote Sensing for Identifying and Monitoring Drought-Prone Areas</h3>
            <p>
                The study of drought and its impact on food security in Kenya has advanced to reliance on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Landsat data are significant in monitoring and understanding the dynamics of drought in the region.

                NDVI is commonly used to measure vegetation health by measuring greenness of vegetation. This parameter is derived from remote sensing data through satellite imagery to assess the severity and extent of drought-induced vegetation stress (El Kenawy, 2018). NDVI data is particularly valuable in the context of food security as it helps in evaluating the impact of drought on agricultural productivity and crop health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Landsat data is also applied in mapping land use and land cover changes. The changes are critical in understanding how land is being utilized and the potential implications on food production and availability during drought periods (El Kenawy, 2018).

                A study by Mwangi et al(2020) demonstrated the significance of these technologies in identifying regions at risk of drought and implementing effective drought management strategies nationwide. By analyzing NDVI and other remotely sensed data, researchers can pinpoint areas susceptible to drought, enabling policymakers and agricultural stakeholders to develop targeted mitigation and adaptation measures.
                
                In-depth research focused on forest mapping using multi-temporal NDVI data has also shed light on the potential applications of this technique in understanding the effects of drought on food security in Africa (Spadoni, 2020). The continuous monitoring of NDVI changes allows for a better understanding of vegetation cover analysis and guides decision-making in drought management and food security initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The integration of Landsat data with NDVI in monitoring drought over time has emerged as a critical approach in effective drought management(Oluwole, 2019). This research revealed that remote sensing data, coupled with NDVI analysis, provides early warning systems and drought management strategies. Monitoring drought-affected districts in Kenya using NDVI and Landsat also facilitates prompt response to emerging food crises and allocating resources where they are most needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the utilization of GIS mapping and remote sensing techniques enhances the study of drought and its impact on food security by highlighting vegetation health, land use changes, and drought monitoring. This enables more informed decision-making and proactive measures to mitigate the adverse effects of drought on food production.
            </p>

            <h3>2: Anthropogenic Activities and Drought</h3>
            <p>
                Kenya's growing population has led to increased demands for food, water, and energy, resulting in intensified human activities such as deforestation, overgrazing, and water resource exploitation (Opiyo, 2018). These anthropogenic changes have disrupted the natural water cycle leading to water shortages and more frequent and severe drought events in the country. The combination of industrialization and climate change has also contributed to irregular weather patterns, further impacting crop yield and food insecurity in the region (Gebrehiwot, 2012).

                Opiyo (2018) highlights that these human-induced changes in the environment have significantly influenced the occurrence and severity of drought in Kenya. Increased water resource exploitation for agriculture and industrial purposes depletes available water supplies, leaving communities more vulnerable to drought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gebrehiwot (2012) emphasizes the interconnectedness of drought and food security in Kenya. The irregular weather patterns caused by climate change directly impact crop growth and yields, leading to reduced agricultural productivity. This, coupled with water scarcity and poor water management practices, hampers the country's ability to produce enough food to meet the demands of its growing population.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research therefore highlights the necessity of adopting integrated drought management strategies through collaboration between various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and local communities to mitigate the impacts of drought on food security.
            </p>

            <h3>3: GIS Mapping for Drought Management in Kenya</h3>
            <p>In order to develop successful drought management policies in Kenya, it is important to thoroughly understand how drought affects the country's food security. In this literature review, I'll look at the state of our understanding of how Kenya's drought may be effectively managed using GIS mapping. </p>
            <p>GIS mapping has been used for identifying and monitoring drought-prone areas mostly in Africa and parts of Russia and Asia, examining the impacts of drought on different sectors, and evaluating drought management options. (Kogan, 1995) </p>
            <p>For instance, the study by (Ayugi, 2022), used GIS mapping to develop a drought early warning system for Kenya's Tana River Basin, which has subsequently been recognized by the Kenyan government as a key instrument for controlling droughts. (Abubakari, 2020) also used GIS mapping in several studies to study the impacts of drought on Kenya's agricultural sector. This approach enabled the identification of vulnerable areas and the formulation of effective drought management strategies for the region.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>This study aims to investigate the impact of drought, urbanization, and industrialization on Kenya's food security using geospatial data and analysis. The following methods will be used to achieve the research goals:</p>
            <p>Data Collection:</p>
            <p>The primary data sources for this study will include Landsat satellite imagery and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. NDVI is a measure of the health of vegetation and will provide information on the extent and severity of drought in Kenya. The Landsat data will be used to create land use and cover maps of Kenya, which will help in identifying the extent of urbanization and industrialization. The NDVI data acquired is from 2010 - 2020 at a defined timeframe; Mid April which is considered suitable as crops are mature enough to be visible from space and not overly mature to the stage where they start drying (Mwangi et al,  2020).</p>

            <p>As was noted by (Panek & Gozdowski, 2020) there is a strong correlation between observed NDVI values and the resultant crop yield. This therefore justifies the use of NDVI as a tool, among others, for drought monitoring as well as for identifying drought prone areas. Besides crop health, a standardized crop stress monitoring is able to give insights on the drought patterns when accurately analyzed (Tadesse, Brown, & Hayes, 2005). It enables researchers to monitor the direct correlation between crop health, crop stress and crop yield in a given study area. In this regard therefore, a Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) analysis using Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) anomaly data  shall be executed as well, so as to support the findings of the research project.</p>
            
            <p>The study will also use secondary data sources such as government reports and published research papers to provide context and additional information on the subject matter. </p>
            <p>Geospatial Analysis:</p>
            <p>The collected data will be processed and analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software, ArcGIS, and Python data tools. The NDVI data will be used to create vegetation health maps, which will help to identify drought-prone areas in Kenya. The Landsat data will be used to map land use and cover and to determine the extent of urbanization and industrialization. The NDVI data and land use and cover maps will be combined to create a comprehensive analysis of the impact of urbanization, industrialization, and drought on Kenya's food security.</p>
            <p>Drought Impact Analysis:</p>
            <p>The study will collect and compare snapshots of NDVI and Landsat imagery to investigate the impact of drought on Kenya's food security. The drought impact analysis will include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification of drought-prone areas by examining past studies on NDVI for drought identification.</li>
                <li>Quantitative analysis of the spatial extent and severity of drought in the identified areas.</li>
                <li>Examination of the relationship between drought and food security, comparing historic NDVI data to historic crop yield from the same period, and running a regression analysis. The study will also use secondary data (e.g. government reports and published research papers) to identify any correlations between drought and food security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drought Management Analysis:</p>
            <p>The study will evaluate the use of GIS mapping for drought management in Kenya. This will include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An examination of existing drought management strategies in Kenya.</li>
                <li>Identification of areas where GIS mapping can be used to improve drought management strategies.</li>
                <li>Development of recommendations for using GIS mapping to improve drought management in Kenya. </li>
